# ReplicaWatcher

Welcome to the GitHub repository for "ReplicaWatcher: Training-less Anomaly Detection in Containerized Microservices", as presented at the **Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2024**.
Our work introduces a novel approach to anomaly detection in containerized microservices that requires no training. For more details, please check out our paper [here](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/replicawatcher-training-less-anomaly-detection-in-containerized-microservices/?_sm_au_=iVVZpt77RHn4jNqr41Vp8K0W0RcLq).

## About ReplicaWatcher

ReplicaWatcher leverages redundancy and narrow functionalities in microservices to detect anomalies by analyzing discrepancies between replicas.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders:

- **chisel**: Contains the code for out customized chisel, designed to extract kernel events generated by replicas. 

- **replicawatcher**: Contains the core logic of ReplicaWatcher. It includes the algorithms and mechanisms for processing the kernel events captured by the chisel, as well as for identifying anomalies.

- **normalityshift**: Contains a demonstration of how an upgrade at the base OS level can lead to changes in the executed system calls.

# ReplicaWatcher

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for "ReplicaWatcher: Training-less Anomaly Detection in Containerized Microservices," as presented at the **Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2024**.
Our work introduces a novel approach to anomaly detection in containerized microservices that requires no training. For more details, please check out our paper [here](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/replicawatcher-training-less-anomaly-detection-in-containerized-microservices/?_sm_au_=iVVZpt77RHn4jNqr41Vp8K0W0RcLq).

## About ReplicaWatcher

ReplicaWatcher leverages the inherent redundancy in microservices architectures to detect anomalies by comparing the behavior of replicas. It does not require training, making it highly adaptable to new and evolving microservices environments.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders:

- **chisel**: Contains the code for Chisel, our custom-built tool for extracting kernel events generated by replicas. 

- **replicawatcher**: Contains the core logic of ReplicaWatcher. It includes the algorithms and mechanisms for processing the kernel events captured by the chisel, as well as for identifying anomalies.

- **normalityshift**: Contains a demonstration of how an upgrade at the base OS level can lead to changes in the executed system calls.
